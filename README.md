# Color_Picker
The Color Picker project is a C++ game featuring a graphical in-
terface. Colored circles fall from the top, while a decision-making
circle at the windowâ€™s center displays a target color. The player
must click on the falling circles that match the target color. The
game tests color recognition and decision-making speed in an
interactive, fun way.
